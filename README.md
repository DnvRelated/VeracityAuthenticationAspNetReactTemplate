# VeracityAuthenticationAspNetReactTemplate

I created this project when I realized that configuring Veracity takes too much of my time, and in the same way that there are templates to jumpstart ASP.NET with React.js development one might get more benefits from a template that already generates some of it's code.

## For whom this project is not
If you don't use [Veracity Authentication](https://www.veracity.com/) you don't need this repository.
